The Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional Chinese festival, so I will use dragon boat to give you an example to illustrate polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation.
Boat class implementation class property name encapsulation
Encapsulation means that the properties of the class cannot be directly accessed and need to be called using the corresponding method
The Dragon Boat class inherits from the Boat class and encapsulates the color attributes.
Its constructor implements polymorphism
Polymorphism means that the function is called in multiple forms, that is, it can accept different numbers of parameters, even different types of parameters
